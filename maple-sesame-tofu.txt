Ingredients

255g Extra Firm Tofu

4 tbsp Sesame Oil

2 tbsp Maple Syrup

1 tbsp Sesame Seeds

Pinch of Salt

Pinch of Pepper

Pinch of Dried Chilli Flakes

Sweet Chilli Sauce

Method

? Begin by wrapping the tofu in kitchen roll and placing it between two heavy flat weights (I suggest chopping boards). Leave it for 15 until all moisture has soaked into the kitchen roll.

? To make the marinade, mix the sesame oil, maple syrup, salt, pepper, chili flakes and sesame seeds.

? Once the tofu has been dried, chop into 2cm cubes and place in the marinade. Leave to marinade for at least 15 minutes.

? Use a large frying pan on high heat to fry the tofu. Turn every minute or so to ensure all four sides become golden brown.

? Serve hot with sweet chili sauce.
